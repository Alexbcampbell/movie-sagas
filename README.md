# Movie-sagas-app

## Description

My goal with this project was to create a movie information app. The home page lists all of my movies and when a movie poster is clicked, the user is brought to a details page for that specific movie. If the user would like to add a movie, there is an add movie page. The add movie page requires a title, image url for the poster, a description of the movie and gives the user a drop down list of options for genre.

Thanks to Prime Digital Academy who equipped and helped me to make this application a reality. I would also like to thank Myron Schippers and Trevor Sansalone for helping me get through this weekend challenge. The Saga garden lecture is what I based most of my work off of.
